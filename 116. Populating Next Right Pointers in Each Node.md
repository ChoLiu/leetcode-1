# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

Given a binary tree

```
struct TreeLinkNode {
  TreeLinkNode *left;
  TreeLinkNode *right;
  TreeLinkNode *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Note:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
- You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).

**Example:**

Given the following perfect binary tree,

```
     1
   /  \
  2    3
 / \  / \
4  5  6  7
```

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

```
     1 -> NULL
   /  \
  2 -> 3 -> NULL
 / \  / \
4->5->6->7 -> NULL
```



## Solution

递归可以做，但是比较慢。



## Code

```python
# Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
# class TreeLinkNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree link node
    # @return nothing
    def connect(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return 
        node = root
        stack = []
        stack2 = []
        pre_dpt = -1
        pre_node = root
        stack.append(node)
        stack2.append(0)
        
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop(0)
            depth = stack2.pop(0)
            if pre_dpt == -1:
                pre_dpt = depth
                cur_dpt = depth
                pre_node = node
            else:
                if depth == pre_dpt:
                    pre_node.next = node
                pre_node = node
                pre_dpt = depth   
            if node.left:
                stack.append(node.left)
                stack2.append(depth+1)
            if node.right:
                stack.append(node.right)
                stack2.append(depth+1)
```
