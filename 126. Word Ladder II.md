# 126. Word Ladder II

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**Note:**

- Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```
