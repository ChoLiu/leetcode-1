# 541. Reverse String II

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.



**Example:**

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```



**Restrictions:**



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        def swap(nums,i,j):
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            
        def reverse(nums,st,ed):
            while st < ed:
                swap(nums,st,ed)
                st += 1
                ed -= 1            
            
        length = len(s)
        chrs = [ch for ch in s]
        st = 0
        while st < length:
            ed = min(length, st + k)
            chrs[st:ed] = reversed(chrs[st:ed])
            st += 2*k
        
        return "".join(chrs)
```
