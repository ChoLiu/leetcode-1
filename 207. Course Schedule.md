# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.





## Solution

图的遍历仿佛失忆般啥都不记得了。

```java
degree[cur] --;
if(degree[cur]==0)
// 可以用下面代替
if(--degree[cur]==0)
// java和C的++操作一样，放后面后算；放前面先算
```





## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        ArrayList[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        int[] degree = new int[numCourses];
        Queue queue = new LinkedList();
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<numCourses;i++)
            graph[i] = new ArrayList();
        
        for(int i=0;i<prerequisites.length;i++)
        {
            graph[prerequisites[i][0]].add(prerequisites[i][1]);
            degree[prerequisites[i][1]] ++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<numCourses;i++)
        {
            if(degree[i]==0)
            {
                queue.add(i);
                count ++;
            }
        }
        
        while(queue.size() > 0)
        {
            int course = (int)queue.poll();
            for(int i=0;i<graph[course].size();i++)
            {
                int cur = (int)graph[course].get(i);
                degree[cur] --;
                if(degree[cur]==0)
                {
                    queue.add(cur);
                    count ++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count == numCourses;        
    }
}
```
