#  \697. Degree of an Array 

Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers `nums`, the **degree** of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of `nums`, that has the same degree as `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
```



**Note:**

`nums.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.

`nums[i]` will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findShortestSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def find_len(num):
            idx1 = nums.index(num)
            index = len(nums) - 1 - nums[::-1].index(num)
            return index - idx1 + 1
            
        items = []
        degree = 0
        record = {}
        for num in nums:
            record[num] = record.get(num, 0) + 1
            if record[num] > degree:
                degree = record[num]
                items = [num]
            elif record[num] == degree:
                items.append(num)
        
        if degree == 1:
            return 1
        
        min_len = len(nums)
        for num in items:
            min_len = min(min_len, find_len(num))
        return min_len
```
