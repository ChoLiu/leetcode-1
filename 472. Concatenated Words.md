# 472. Concatenated Words

Given a list of words (**without duplicates**

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]

Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]

Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats";  "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```



**Note:**

1. The number of elements of the given array will not exceed `10,000`
2. The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed `600,000`.
3. All the input string will only include lower case letters.
4. The returned elements order does not matter.
