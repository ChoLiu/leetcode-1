# 64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a *m* x *n* grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which *minimizes* the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```



## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        table = grid[:][:]       
        for i in range(0, m):
            for j in range(0, n):
                if i==0 and j==0:
                    table[i][j] = grid[i][j]
                elif i==0:
                    table[i][j] = grid[i][j] + table[i][j-1]
                elif j==0:
                    table[i][j] = grid[i][j] + table[i-1][j]
                else:
                    table[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(table[i-1][j], table[i][j-1])

        return table[-1][-1]
```
