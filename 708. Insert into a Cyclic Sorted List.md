# [Insert into a Cyclic Sorted List 在循环有序的链表中插入结点](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/9981163.html)

Given a node from a cyclic linked list which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value into the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node can be a reference to *any* single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the cyclic list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the cyclic list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., given node is `null`), you should create a new single cyclic list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.

The following example may help you understand the problem better:

 

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/insertcyclicbefore.png)

In the figure above, there is a cyclic sorted list of three elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list.

 

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/insertcyclicafter.png)

The new node should insert between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.



## Solution

一共三种情况：

> head为空
>
> 插在increasing之间
>
> 插在头尾之间(又分两种，大于尾，或者小于头)





## Code

```python
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None


def insert_node(pre,node,cur):
    pre.next = node
    node.next = cur


node1 = ListNode(4)
# node2 = ListNode(1)
node3 = ListNode(3)
node1.next = node3
# node2.next=  node3
node3.next = node1
head = node3

node = ListNode(33)
if head is None:
    head = node
    head.next = head

else:
    pre = head
    cur = head.next
    while 1:
        if cur.val >= node.val >= pre.val:
            insert_node(pre,node,cur)
            break
        elif pre.val >= cur.val >= node.val or node.val >= pre.val >= cur.val:
            insert_node(pre,node,cur)
            break
        elif cur == pre:
            insert_node(pre, node, cur)
            break
        else:
            pre = cur
            cur = cur.next

for _ in range(5):
    print(head.val)
    head = head.next
```
