# [[LeetCode\] Next Closest Time 下一个最近时间点](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/7623614.html)

Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

Example 1:

```
Input: "19:34"
Output: "19:39"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
```

 

Example 2:

```
Input: "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.
```



## Code

```python
def combinations(time):
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            string = time[i]+time[j]
            key = int(string)
            if key not in choice:
                choice[key] = string

def find_choice(low,up):
    curmin = float('inf')
    for key in choice.keys():
        if up > key > low and key < curmin:
            curmin = key
    return choice[curmin] if curmin != float('inf') else ""

time = "02:23"
hour,minute = [int(k) for k in time.split(":")]
choice = {}
time = time.replace(":","")
combinations(time)
# only minute
new_minute = find_choice(minute,60)
new_hour = find_choice(hour,24)
if new_minute:
    print(choice[hour]+":"+new_minute)

elif new_hour:
    new_minute = find_choice(-1,60)
    print(new_hour+":"+new_minute)

else:
    new_minute = find_choice(-1, 60)
    new_hour = find_choice(-1, 24)
    print(new_hour+":" + new_minute)
```
