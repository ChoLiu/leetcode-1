# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
    2
   / \
  1   3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6
Output: false
Explanation: The input is: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]. The root node's value
             is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```



## Solution

中序遍历然后判断是否是**严格**递增数列即可。



## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # inorder traverse
        if root is None:
            return True
        flag = 0
        previous = None
        current = 0
        node = root
        stack = []
        while stack or node:
            while node:
                stack.append(node)
                node = node.left
                
            node = stack.pop()
            
            if previous is None:
                previous = node.val
            else:
                current = node.val
                if current <= previous:
                    return False
                previous = current
                
            node = node.right
        return True
```
