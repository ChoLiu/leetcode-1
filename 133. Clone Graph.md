## 133. Clone Graph

Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` (`int`) and a list (`List[UndirectedGraphNode]`) of its `neighbors`. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization (so you can understand error output):

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use



```
#
```

 

as a separator for each node, and

 

```
,
```

 

as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

 

As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

 

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

**Note**: The information about the tree serialization is only meant so that you can understand error output if you get a wrong answer. You don't need to understand the serialization to solve the problem.



## Solution

总结回顾了一下graph里面的DFS和BFS，两者唯一的区别就在于**pop的时候从头开始还是从尾开始**，前者是BFS，后者是DFS。

代码见下。

从neighbors里面得到没访问过的neighbor的时候，有四个步骤：

- 复制一个新的neighborcopy
- 把neighbor和neighborcopy压入dict，建立联系，表示已经访问过了
- 建立当前node和neighbor之间的连接关系

- 把neighbor压入stack，准备下次访问

  

## Code(BFS)

```python
# Definition for a undirected graph node
# class UndirectedGraphNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.label = x
#         self.neighbors = []

class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        if node is None:
            return
        nodecopy = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        dic = {node: nodecopy}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop(0)
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in dic:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
                    neighborcopy = UndirectedGraphNode(neighbor.label)
                    dic[neighbor] = neighborcopy
                    dic[node].neighbors.append(neighborcopy)
                else:
                    dic[node].neighbors.append(dic[neighbor])
        return nodecopy
```



## Code(DFS)

```python
def cloneGraph_DFS(self, node):
        if node is None:
            return
        nodecopy = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        dic = {node:nodecopy}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in dic:
                    neighborcopy = UndirectedGraphNode(neighbor.label)
                    dic[neighbor] = neighborcopy
                    dic[node].neighbors.append(neighborcopy)
                    stack.append(neighbor)
                else:
                    dic[node].neighbors.append(dic[neighbor])
        return nodecopy
```



### Code(BFS) - Java

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<Node, Node>();
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null)
            return null;
        if(map.containsKey(node))
            return map.get(node);
        
        Node tmp = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<Node>());
        for(Node neighbor : node.neighbors)
        {
            tmp.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(neighbor));
        }
        return map.get(node);       
    }
}
```
