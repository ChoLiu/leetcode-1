## 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.



**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

**Resolution:**

稍微复杂一点的链表基本操作...
写了半个小时...如果是面试大概就直接挂了...

过几天重新看一下！



**Code:**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None


def reverseListNode(head, tail):

    if tail:
        tail.next = None
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next=head
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return [head, head]
    if head.next.next is None:
        new_head = head.next
        new_head.next = head
        head.next = None
        return [new_head, dummy.next]
    zeroth = head
    first = zeroth.next
    second = first.next
    while first.next:
        first.next = zeroth
        zeroth = first
        first = second
        second = second.next
    first.next = zeroth
    return [first, dummy.next]
    

class Solution:

    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        cur = dummy
        while cur:
            st = cur.next
            ed = cur
            count = 0
            while count < k and ed.next is not None:
                ed = ed.next
                count += 1
            if count < k:
                break

            last = ed.next
            cur.next = ed
            [new_st, new_ed] = reverseListNode(st, ed)
            new_ed.next = last
            cur = new_ed
        
        return dummy.next
```
