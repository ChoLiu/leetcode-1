# 70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```



## Code1

递归

```python
def find_way(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return find_way(n-1) + find_way(n-2)
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return find_way(n)
```



## Code2

DP

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return n
        elif n == 2:
            return 2
        
        ways = [0 for k in range(n)]
        ways[0] = 1
        ways[1] = 2
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0 or i == 1:
                continue
            ways[i] = ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]
        return ways[-1]
        
```
