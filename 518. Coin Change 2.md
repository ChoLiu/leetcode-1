# 518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.



 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```

 

**Note:**

You can assume that

- 0 <= amount <= 5000
- 1 <= coin <= 5000
- the number of coins is less than 500
- the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer



注意一下DP的时候怎么排除重复项

## Code1递归

```python
class Solution(object):
    def change(self, amount, coins):
        """
        :type amount: int
        :type coins: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        length = len(coins)
        if amount == 0:
            return 1
        if length == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            for i,coin in enumerate(coins):
                if coin < amount:
                    cur = self.change(amount-coin,coins[i:])
                    count += cur
                elif coin == amount:
                    count += 1
        return count
```
