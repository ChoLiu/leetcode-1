# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```



## Solution

是没见过这么easy的题目。



## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int st = 0;
        int ed = numbers.length-1;
        int[] res = new int[2];
        while(st<ed)
        {
            if(numbers[st]+numbers[ed]>target)
                ed --;
            else if(numbers[st]+numbers[ed]<target)
                st++;
            else
            {
                res[0] = st+1;
                res[1] = ed+1;
                break;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
