# [⭐] 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```



**Example 3:**

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        s_set = set(s)
        table = []
        for val in s_set:
            table.append((val,s.count(val)))
        table.sort(key = lambda x: x[1], reverse = True)
        return ''.join(map(lambda x: x[0] * x[1], table))
        # print(table)
        # res = ""
        # for(c,i) in table:
        #     while i > 0:
        #         res += c
        #         i -= 1
        # return res
        
```
