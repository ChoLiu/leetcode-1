# [Closest Binary Search Tree Value 最近的二分搜索树的值](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5237170.html)

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:

- Given target value is a floating point.
- You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.



## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def inorderTraversal(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        minval = 0
        mindiff = float('inf')
        node = root
        target = 5
        while node:
            diff = node.val - target
            if mindiff > abs(diff):
                mindiff = abs(diff)
                minval = node.val
            if diff > 0:
                node = node.left
            elif diff < 0:
                node = node.right
            else:
                break
        return minval
```
