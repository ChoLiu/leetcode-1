# 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent

You have `N` gardens, labelled `1` to `N`.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

`paths[i] = [x, y]` describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden `x` to garden `y`.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return **any** such a choice as an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the `(i+1)`-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

 

**Note:**

- `1 <= N <= 10000`
- `0 <= paths.size <= 20000`
- No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
- It is guaranteed an answer exists.
