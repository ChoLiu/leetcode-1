# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only *distinct* numbers from the original list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->3->4->4->5
Output: 1->2->5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1->1->1->2->3
Output: 2->3
```



## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        first = dummy
        second = dummy.next
        if second is not None and second.next is not None:
            third = second.next
        else:
            return dummy.next
        while third:
            if second.val == third.val:
                while third and second.val == third.val:
                    third = third.next
                first.next = third
                second = third
                if third is not None:
                    third = third.next
            else:
                first = second
                second = third
                third = third.next
        return dummy.next
        
```
