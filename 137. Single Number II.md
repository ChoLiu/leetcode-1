# 137. Single Number II

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *three* times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```



## Code

```
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        dic = {}
        for num in nums:
            dic[num] = dic.get(num,0)+1
        for key,val in dic.items():
            if val == 1:
                return key
```
