# 5216. Count Vowels Permutation

Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed under the following rules:

- Each character is a lower case vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`)
- Each vowel `'a'` may only be followed by an `'e'`.
- Each vowel `'e'` may only be followed by an `'a'` or an `'i'`.
- Each vowel `'i'` **may not** be followed by another `'i'`.
- Each vowel `'o'` may only be followed by an `'i'` or a `'u'`.
- Each vowel `'u'` may only be followed by an `'a'.`

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7.`

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: All possible strings are: "a", "e", "i" , "o" and "u".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible strings are: "ae", "ea", "ei", "ia", "ie", "io", "iu", "oi", "ou" and "ua".
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 68
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countVowelPermutation(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # number of strings end with a, e, i, o, u
        count = [1 for _ in range(5)]
        while n > 1:
            n -= 1
            count[0],count[1],count[2],count[3],count[4]  = count[1] + count[2] + count[4], count[0] + count[2], count[1] + count[3], count[2], count[2] + count[3]
            # count[1] = count[0] + count[2]
            # count[2] = count[1] + count[3]
            # count[3] = count[2]
            # count[4] = count[2] + count[2]
        return sum(count) % (pow(10,9)+7)
        
```
