# 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if x == 1 or x == 0: 
            return x
        st = 1
        ed = x//2
        while st < ed:
            cur = (st+ed+1)//2
            num1 = cur*cur
            num2 = (cur+1)*(cur+1)
            if num1 <= x and num2 > x:
                return cur
            elif num1 > x:
                ed = cur - 1
            elif num1 < x:
                st = cur + 1
        return st
```
