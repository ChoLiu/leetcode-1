# [340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters 最多有K个不同字符的最长子串](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5351347.html)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most *k* distinct characters.

For example, Given s = `“eceba”` and k = 2,

T is "ece" which its length is 3.



## Code

```python
def longestsubstring(s, k):
    map = {}
    count = k
    longest = 0
    st = 0
    ed = 0
    length = len(s)
    while ed < length:
        ch = s[ed]
        ed += 1
        map[ch] = map.get(ch, 0) + 1
        if map[ch] == 1:
            count -= 1

        while count < 0:
            ch = s[st]
            map[ch] = map.get(ch, 0) - 1
            if map[ch]==0:
                count += 1
            st += 1

        if count >= 0:
            longest = max(longest, ed - st)
    return longest

s = "eceba"
k = 2
print(longestsubstring(s, k))
```
