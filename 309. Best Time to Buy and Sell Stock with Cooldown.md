# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```



## Solution

行吧我为discussion里面的神仙解法，以及一步一步继续简化变量和方法的算法折服，深深地折服。

我之后一定会看不懂代码的，戳[这里](<https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/discuss/75927/Share-my-thinking-process>)重新看讲解吧。



## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length;
        // int[] buy = new int[len+1];
        // int[] sell = new int[len+1];
        int sell = 0;
        int sell_pre = 0;
        int buy = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int buy_pre = buy;
        for(int price:prices)
        {
            buy_pre = buy;
            buy = Math.max(buy_pre,sell_pre-price);
            sell_pre = sell;
            sell = Math.max(sell_pre,buy_pre+price);
        }
        return sell;
    }
}
