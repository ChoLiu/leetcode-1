# 528. Random Pick with Weight

Given an array `w` of positive integers, where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`, write a function `pickIndex` which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1. `1 <= w.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
3. `pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
```

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array `w`. `pickIndex` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.



## Solution

没啥难度，intuitive的思路。然后注意查找的时候用一下二分不然会超时。O(n) → O(lgn)



## Code

```python
import random
class Solution(object):

    def __init__(self, w):
        """
        :type w: List[int]
        """
        self.weight = w
        self.weightsum = [k for k in w]
        for i in range(1,len(w)):
            self.weightsum[i] = self.weightsum[i]+self.weightsum[i-1]

    def pickIndex(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        pick = random.randint(1,self.weightsum[-1])
        # print(pick)
        st = 0
        ed = len(self.weightsum)-1
        while st < ed:
            mid = (st+ed)/2
            num = self.weightsum[mid]
            if num < pick:
                st = mid + 1
            elif num > pick:
                ed = mid
            else:
                st = mid
                ed = mid
        return st
```
