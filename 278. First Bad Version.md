# 278. First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```



## Solution

有个隐藏很深的坑我靠惊了...还能这么挖的吗？

````java
int mid = st+(ed-st)/2;	//这个正常
int mid = (st+ed)/2;	//这个如果是两个大数的话会越界
````



## Code

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        // 1~n
        int st = 1;
        int ed = n;
        // System.out.println("before:\t"+(st+ed)/2);
        // System.out.println("after:\t"+(st+(ed-st)/2));
        while(st<ed)
        {
            int mid = st+(ed-st)/2;
            // int mid = (st+ed)/2;
            if(isBadVersion(mid))
                ed = mid;
            else
                st = mid+1;
        }
        return st;
    }
}
```
