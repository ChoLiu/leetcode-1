# 246. Strobogrammatic Number

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

Example 1:

```
Input:  "69"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input:  "88"
Output: true
```

Example 3:

```
Input:  "962"
Output: false
```



## Code

```python
record = {'0':'0', '1':'1', '8':'8','6':'9','9':'6'}
def isStrobogrammatic(num):
    length = len(num)
    st = 0
    ed = length-1
    while st < ed:
        if num[st] not in record or num[ed] not in record:
            return False
        return record[num[st]] == num[ed]

print(isStrobogrammatic("111")
```
