# 503. Next Greater Element II

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; The number 2 can't find next greater number; The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```



**Note:** The length of given array won't exceed 10000.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        length = len(nums)
#         if length <= 1:
#             return [-1 for _ in range()]
        
        stackIdx = []
        stackNum = []
        res = [-1 for _ in range(length)]
        for _ in range(2):
            for i,num in enumerate(nums):
                while stackNum and stackNum[-1]<num:
                    prenum = stackNum.pop()
                    preidx = stackIdx.pop()
                    if res[preidx] == -1:
                        res[preidx] = num
                stackIdx.append(i)
                stackNum.append(num)
        return res
```
