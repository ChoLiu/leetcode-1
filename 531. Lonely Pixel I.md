# 531. Lonely Pixel I

Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, find the number of black lonely pixels.

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.

A black lonely pixel is character 'B' that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.

Example:

```
Input: 
[['W', 'W', 'B'],
 ['W', 'B', 'W'],
 ['B', 'W', 'W']]

Output: 3
Explanation: All the three 'B's are black lonely pixels.
```

 

Note:

1. The range of width and height of the input 2D array is [1,500].



## Code

```python
matrix = [['W', 'W', 'B'], ['W', 'B', 'W'], ['B', 'W', 'W']]
indexs = {}
height = len(matrix)
width = len(matrix[0])
lonelyCount = 0
for h in range(height):
    count = 0
    index = [0, 0]
    for w in range(width):
        if matrix[h][w] == 'B':
            count += 1
            index = [h, w]
    if count == 1:
        indexs[str(index)] = 1

for w in range(width):
    count = 0
    index = [0, 0]
    for h in range(height):
        if matrix[h][w] == 'B':
            count += 1
            index = [h, w]
    if count == 1 and str(index) in indexs:
        lonelyCount += 1
print(lonelyCount)
```
