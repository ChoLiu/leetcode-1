# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Solution

我觉得过于作弊了code1这个方法...虽然确实只要遍历一次...

然后code2和我初始想法几乎一样，我写的时候边界等一些细节没考虑到所有报错了。

## Code1

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        size = len(nums)
        if size == 0 or size == 1:
            return
        count = [0,0,0]
        for c in nums:
            count[c] += 1
        
        nums[0:count[0]] = [0 for k in range(count[0])]
        nums[count[0]:count[0]+count[1]] = [1 for k in range(count[1])]
        nums[count[0]+count[1]:] = [2 for k in range(count[2])]
```

## Code2

```python
def swap(nums,i,j):
    tmp = nums[i]
    nums[i] = nums[j]
    nums[j] = tmp
    

class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        size = len(nums)
        left = 0
        right = size-1
        mid = left

        while mid <= right:
            if nums[mid] == 0:
                swap(nums, mid, left)
                left += 1
                mid += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 2:
                swap(nums, mid, right)
                right -= 1
            else:
                mid += 1
```
