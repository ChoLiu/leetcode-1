# 399. Evaluate Division

Equations are given in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

**Example:**
Given `a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.`
queries are: `a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .`
return `[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].`

The input is: `vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries `, where `equations.size() == values.size()`, and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return `vector<double>`.

According to the example above:

```
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
```

 

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
