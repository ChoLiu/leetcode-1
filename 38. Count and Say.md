# 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```



## Solution

理解题目之后就不难了！整数转char的时候直接用str(4)就行。



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        str1 = "1"
        count = 1
        while count < n:
            count += 1
            cur_char = str1[0]
            # print(cur_char)
            cur_count = 1
            str2 = ""
            for i in range(1,len(str1)):
                c = str1[i]
                if c == cur_char:
                    cur_count += 1
                else:
                    str2 = str2 + (str(cur_count))
                    str2 = str2 + (cur_char)
                    cur_char = c
                    cur_count = 1
                    
            str2 = str2 + (str(cur_count))
            str2 = str2 + (cur_char)
            str1 = str2
            # print(str1)
        return str1
```
