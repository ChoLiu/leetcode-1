# 286. Walls and Gates

You are given a *m x n* 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. `-1` - A wall or an obstacle.
2. `0` - A gate.
3. `INF` - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its *nearest* gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

For example, given the 2D grid:

```
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

```
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```



## Code

```python
def bfs(grid, i, j, dist):
    if grid[i][j] == -1:
        return
    queue = []
    queue.append([i,j,dist])
    while queue:
        i,j,dist = queue.pop(0)
        if grid[i][j] < dist:
            continue
        grid[i][j] = dist
        if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j]>dist+1:
            queue.append([i-1,j,dist+1])
        if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1]>dist+1:
            queue.append([i,j-1,dist+1])
        if i < len(grid)-1 and grid[i+1][j]>dist+1:
            queue.append([i+1,j,dist+1])
        if j < len(grid[0])-1 and grid[i][j+1]>dist+1:
            queue.append([i,j+1,dist+1])

grid = [[float('inf'),-1,0,float('inf')], [float('inf'),float('inf'),float('inf'),-1], [float('inf'), -1, float('inf'), -1], [0, -1, float('inf'), float('inf')]]

height = len(grid)
width = len(grid[0])
for i in range(height):
    for j in range(width):
        if grid[i][j] == 0: # when we reach a door
            bfs(grid, i, j, 0)

print(grid)
```
