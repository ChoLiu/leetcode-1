# [277. Find the Celebrity 寻找名人](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5310649.html)

Suppose you are at a party with `n` people (labeled from `0` to `n - 1`) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)`which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: graph = [
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```

Example 2:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/02/277_example_2.PNG)

```
Input: graph = [
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
```

 

Note:

1. The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is an `n x n` matrix where `a[i][j] = 1` means person `i` knows person `j` while `a[i][j] = 0` means the contrary.
2. Remember that you won't have direct access to the adjacency matrix.



## Solution

下面这种方法是网上比较流行的一种方法，设定候选人 res 为0，原理是先遍历一遍，对于遍历到的人i，若候选人 res 认识i，则将候选人 res 设为i，完成一遍遍历后，我们来检测候选人 res 是否真正是名人，我们如果判断不是名人，则返回 -1，如果并没有冲突，返回 res，参见代码如下：

由热心网友 [fgvlty](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5310649.html#3671328) 提醒，我们还可以进一步减少 API 的调用量，找候选者的方法跟上面相同，但是在验证的时候，分为两段，先验证候选者前面的所有人，若候选者认识任何人，或者任何人不认识候选者，直接返回 -1。再验证候选者后面的人，这时候只需要验证是否有人不认识候选者就可以了，因为我们在最开始找候选者的时候就已经保证了候选者不会认识后面的任何人，参见代码如下：

## Code

```python
bool knows(int a, int b);
class Solution {
public:
    int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (knows(res, i)) res = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < res; ++i) {
            if (knows(res, i) || !knows(i, res)) return -1;
        }
        for (int i = res + 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!knows(i, res)) return -1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
