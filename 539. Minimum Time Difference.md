# 539. Minimum Time Difference

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum **minutes**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```



**Note:**

1. The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
2. The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints):
        """
        :type timePoints: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        length = len(timePoints)
        time = [0 for _ in range(length)]
        for i,t in enumerate(timePoints):
            time[i] = int(t[:2])*60 + int(t[3:])
        
        time.sort()
        # print(time)
        mindiff = float('inf')
        for i in range(length):
            if i < length-1:
                mindiff = min(mindiff,time[i+1]-time[i])
            else:
                mindiff = min(mindiff,time[0]-time[i]+24*60)
        return mindiff
```
