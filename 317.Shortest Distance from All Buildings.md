# 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings 建筑物的最短距离

You want to build a house on an *empty* land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

- Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
- Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
- Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

For example, given three buildings at `(0,0)`, `(0,4)`, `(2,2)`, and an obstacle at `(0,2)`:

```
1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
```

The point `(1,2)` is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

Note:
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

## Solution

dfs递归容易写，但需要多次修改值，TLE。

bfs用迭代能做，麻烦些但是很快。

都要会。



## Code

```python
def dfs(cur,h,w,dist):
    if h < 0 or w < 0 or h >= len(dist) or w >= len(dist[0]):
        return
    if land[h][w] == 0 and (dist[h][w] == -1 or cur < dist[h][w]):
        dist[h][w] = cur
        bfs(cur + 1, h - 1, w, dist)
        bfs(cur + 1, h, w - 1, dist)
        bfs(cur + 1, h + 1, w, dist)
        bfs(cur + 1, h, w + 1, dist)

def bfs(cur,h,w,dist):
    queue = []
    queued = []
    queue.append([h, w])
    queued.append(cur)
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.pop(0)
        cur = queued.pop(0)
        if dist[i][j] == -1:
            dist[i][j] = cur
            if 0<=i-1<len(dist) and 0<=j<len(dist[0]) and land[i-1][j] == 0:
                queue.append([i - 1, j])
                queued.append(cur + 1)
            if 0<=i+1<len(dist) and 0<=j<len(dist[0]) and land[i+1][j] == 0:
                queue.append([i + 1, j])
                queued.append(cur + 1)
            if 0<=i<len(dist) and 0<=j-1<len(dist[0]) and land[i][j-1] == 0:
                queue.append([i, j-1])
                queued.append(cur + 1)
            if 0<=i<len(dist) and 0<=j+1<len(dist[0]) and land[i][j+1] == 0:
                queue.append([i, j+1])
                queued.append(cur + 1)

land = [[1,0,2,0,0],[0,0,2,2,2],[1,0,0,0,1]]
height = len(land)
width = len(land[0])

total_dist = [[0 for _ in item] for item in land]
for h in range(height):
    for w in range(width):
        if land[h][w] == 1:
            curdist = [[-1 for _ in item] for item in land]
            bfs(0, h, w, curdist)
            # dfs(1, h - 1, w, curdist)
            # dfs(1, h, w - 1, curdist)
            # dfs(1, h + 1, w, curdist)
            # dfs(1, h, w + 1, curdist)
            print(curdist)
            for hh in range(height):
                for ww in range(width):
                    total_dist[hh][ww] += curdist[hh][ww]

print(total_dist)
mindist = float('inf')
for hh in range(height):
    for ww in range(width):
        if total_dist[hh][ww] >= 0:
            mindist = min(mindist,total_dist[hh][ww])

if mindist == float('inf'):
    print(-1)
else:
    print(mindist)
```
