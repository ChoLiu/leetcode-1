# 474. Ones and Zeroes

In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of **m** `0s` and **n** `1s` respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only `0s` and `1s`.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given **m** `0s` and **n** `1s`. Each `0` and `1` can be used at most **once**.

**Note:**

1. The given numbers of `0s` and `1s` will both not exceed `100`
2. The size of given string array won't exceed `600`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2

Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
```

            num1 = len(strs[idx])-num0
            if idx >= len(strs):
                return 0
            elif idx == len(strs)-1:
                if num0<=m and num1<=n:
                    return 1

                else:
                    return helper(strs,idx+1,m,n)
        
        return helper(strs,0,m,n)
