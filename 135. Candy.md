# 135. Candy

There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```



## Solution

太难了，想了二十分钟完全没思路...

答案过于机智，所以我觉得面试不会问到的...

9.25做了第二次，思路是对的，但是``ret += 1 + down + (peak >= down ? -1 : 0)``这个操作没想到。



## Code

```C++
public int Candy(int[] ratings) {
            if (ratings.Length == 0) return 0;
            int ret = 1;
            int up = 0, down = 0, peak = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < ratings.Length; i++) {
                if (ratings[i - 1] < ratings[i]) {
                    peak = ++up;
                    down = 0;
                    ret += 1 + up;
                } else if (ratings[i - 1] == ratings[i])  {
                    peak = up = down = 0;
                    ret += 1;
                } else {
                    up = 0;
                    down++;
                    ret += 1 + down + (peak >= down ? -1 : 0);
                }
            }

            return ret;
        }
```
