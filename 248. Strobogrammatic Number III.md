# [248. Strobogrammatic Number III 对称数之三](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5203228.html)

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

Example:

```
Input: low = "50", high = "100"
Output: 3 
Explanation: 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
```

Note:
Because the range might be a large number, the *low*and *high* numbers are represented as string.



## Code

```python
def find_count(low, high, path):
    if len(high) >= len(path) >= len(low):
        if len(path)>1 and path[0]=='0':
            return 0
        if len(path) == len(low) and path<low or len(path)==len(high) and path>high:
            return 0
        print(path)
        return 1

    if len(path)+2<=len(high):
        res = 0
        res += find_count(low, high, "1" + path + "1")
        res += find_count(low, high, "0" + path + "0")
        res += find_count(low, high, "8" + path + "8")
        res += find_count(low, high, "6" + path + "9")
        res += find_count(low, high, "9" + path + "6")
        return res

low = "50"
high = "100"
res = 0
res += find_count(low, high, "")
res += find_count(low, high, "0")
res += find_count(low, high, "1")
res += find_count(low, high, "8")

print(res)
```
