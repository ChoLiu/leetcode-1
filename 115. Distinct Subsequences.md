# 115. Distinct Subsequences

Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **S** which equals **T**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```



## Solution

DP很好用，想清楚就不容易出bug。



## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(s)
        m = len(t)
        if m > n:
            return 0
        # if m == n:
        #     if s == t:
        #         return 1
        #     else:
        #         return 0
        result = []
        result.append([1 for _ in range(n+1)])
        for k in range(m):
            result.append([0 for _ in range(n+1)])
        for i in range(1,m+1):
            for j in range(1,n+1):
                result[i][j] = result[i][j-1]
                if t[i-1] == s[j-1]:
                    result[i][j] += result[i-1][j-1]
        print(result[-1][-1])
        return result[-1][-1]
```
