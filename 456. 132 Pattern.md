# [⭐] 456. 132 Pattern

Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence a**i**, a**j**, a**k** such that **i** < **j** < **k** and a**i** < a**k** < a**j**. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

**Note:** n will be less than 15,000.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
```



**Example 3:**

```
Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
```
