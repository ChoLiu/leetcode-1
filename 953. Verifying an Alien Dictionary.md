# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= words.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
3. `order.length == 26`
4. All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are english lowercase letters.

```python

        :type words: List[str]
        :type order: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def find_diff(wd1,wd2):
            minlen = min(len(wd1),len(wd2))
            i = 0
            while i < minlen and wd1[i]==wd2[i]:
                i += 1
            return i if i < minlen else -1
            
            
        word_num = len(words)
        for i in range(1,word_num):
            wd1 = words[i-1]
            wd2 = words[i]
            diff_idx = find_diff(wd1,wd2)
            if diff_idx == -1:
                if len(wd1)>len(wd2):
                    return False
            else:
                if order.index(wd1[diff_idx]) > order.index(wd2[diff_idx]):
                    return False
        return True
```
