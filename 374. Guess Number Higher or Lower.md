# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example :**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```



## Code

```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int st = 1;
        int ed = n;
        while(st < ed)
        {
            int mid = st + (ed - st)/2;
            // System.out.println(mid);
            int res = guess(mid);
            if(res==0)
                return mid;
            if(res == 1)
                st = mid+1;
            else
                ed = mid-1;                
        }
        return st;
    }
}
```
