# 338. Counting Bits

Given a non negative integer number **num**. For every numbers **i** in the range **0 ≤ i ≤ num**calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time **O(n\*sizeof(integer))**. But can you do it in linear time **O(n)** /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be **O(n)**.
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like **__builtin_popcount** in c++ or in any other language.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] res = new int[num+1];
        int len = 1;
        int st = 1;
        int i = 0;
        while(len<=num)
        {
            for(i=0;i<len;i++)
            {
                if(len+i>num)
                    break;
                res[len+i] = 1 + res[i];   
            }
            len*=2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
