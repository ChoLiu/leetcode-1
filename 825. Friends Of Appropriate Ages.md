# 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

- `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
- `age[B] > age[A]`
- `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
```

 

Notes:

- `1 <= ages.length <= 20000`.
- `1 <= ages[i] <= 120`.

        :type ages: List[int]
        :rtype: int

        pre_count = 0
        for i, age in enumerate(ages):
            if i > 0 and age == ages[i-1]:
                request_count += pre_count
            else:
                if i == 0 or age != ages[i-1]:
                    cur_st = i

                max_age = (age - 7) * 2
                st = cur_st
                ed = length - 1
                while st < ed:
                    mid = (st + ed + 1) / 2
                    if ages[mid] >= max_age:
                        ed = mid - 1
                    else:
                        st = mid
                # print(request_count)
                pre_count = st - cur_st
                request_count += pre_count
        return request_count
```
