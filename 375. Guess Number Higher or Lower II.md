# 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay **$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

**Example:**

```
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
```

Given a particular **n ≥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a **win**.



## Solution

要求的是最坏情况下的最小值。

所以一个对应max一个对应min，注意一下思路。



## Code

```java
class Solution {
    int [][]table;
    public int helper(int n, int st, int ed)
    {
        if(st>ed)
            return 0;
        
        if(table[st][ed]==-1)
        {
            int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            if(st>=ed)
                res = 0;
            else
            {
                for(int idx=st;idx<=ed;idx++)
                {
                    int tmp = Math.max(helper(n,st,idx-1), helper(n,idx+1,ed));
                    res = Math.min(res, idx+1 + tmp);
                }
            }
            table[st][ed] = res;
        }
        return table[st][ed];
    }
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        table = new int[n][n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
                table[i][j] = -1;
        
        return helper(n,0,n-1);   
    }
}
```
