# [269. Alien Dictionary 另类字典](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5250200.html)

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.

**Example 1:**
Given the following words in dictionary,

```
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]
```



The correct order is: `"wertf"`.

**Example 2:**
Given the following words in dictionary,

```
[
  "z",
  "x"
]
```



The correct order is: `"zx"`.

**Example 3:**
Given the following words in dictionary,

```
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]
```



The order is invalid, so return `""`.

**Note:**

1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.



Thought process:

Topological sort:

1. Build graph: 

2. 1. a map of character -> set of character.
   2. Also get in-degrees for each character. In-degrees will be a map of character -> integer.

3. Topological sort:

4. 1. Loop through in-degrees. Offer the characters with in-degree of 0 to queue.

   2. While queue is not empty:

   3. 1. Poll from queue. Append to character to result string.
      2. Decrease the in-degree of polled character's children by 1.
      3. If any child's in-degree decreases to 0, offer it to queue.

   4. At last, if result string's length is less than the number of vertices, that means there is a cycle in my graph. The order is invalid.




## Code

```python
words = ["z", "x"]
in_degree = [0 for _ in range(26)]
point_to = [[] for _ in range(26)]
hash_set = set()
char_set = set()
queue = []
for word in words:
    for ch in word:
        char_set.add(ord(ch)-ord('a'))

for i in range(1, len(words)):
    word1 = words[i-1]
    word2 = words[i]
    len1 = len(word1)
    len2 = len(word2)
    pt = 0
    while pt < min(len1, len2) and word1[pt]==word2[pt]:
        pt += 1
    if pt < len1 and pt < len2:
        idx1 = ord(word1[pt]) - ord('a')
        idx2 = ord(word2[pt])-ord('a')
        if word2[pt] not in point_to[idx1]:
            point_to[idx1].append(ord(word2[pt])-ord('a'))
            in_degree[idx2] += 1

res = ""
count = 0
for ch in char_set:
    if in_degree[ch] == 0:
        queue.append(ch)

while queue:
    char = queue.pop()
    count += 1
    res += chr(char+ord('a'))
    for pt in point_to[char]:
        in_degree[pt] -= 1
        if in_degree[pt] == 0:
            queue.append(pt)

if count < len(char_set):
    print("Invalid")
else:
    print(res)
```
