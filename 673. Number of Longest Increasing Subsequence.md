#  \673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence 

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```



**Note:** Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.



## Solution

方法和之前找longest increasing subsequence的方法类似，但是需要记录当前的数量。

方法绝了。



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        length = len(nums)
        dp = [[1, 1] for _ in range(length)]
        longest = 1
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            cur_longest = 1
            count = 0
            for j in range(i):
                if num > nums[j]:
                    if dp[j][0]+1 > cur_longest:
                        count = dp[j][1]
                        cur_longest = dp[j][0]+1
                    elif dp[j][0]+1 == cur_longest:
                        count += dp[j][1]
        
            dp[i] = [cur_longest, max(count,dp[i][1])]
            longest = max(longest, cur_longest)
        return sum(item[1] for item in dp if item[0]==longest)
```
