# [296. Best Meeting Point 最佳开会地点](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5291058.html)

A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group. The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where distance(p1, p2) = `|p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

Example:

```
Input: 

1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 6 

Explanation: Given three people living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2):
             The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance 
             of 2+2+2=6 is minimal. So return 6.
```

**Hint:**

1. Try to solve it in one dimension first. How can this solution apply to the two dimension case?



## Solution

可以哦这个hint很有用。不用bfs遍历了。



## Code

```python
def BestMeetPoint(grid):
    height = len(grid)
    width = len(grid[0])
    xaxis = []
    yaxis = []
    res = 0
    for w in range(width):
        for h in range(height):
            if grid[h][w] == 1:
                xaxis.append(w)

    for h in range(height):
        for w in range(width):
            if grid[h][w] == 1:
                yaxis.append(h)

    st = 0
    ed = len(xaxis)-1
    while st < ed:
        res += xaxis[ed]-xaxis[st] + yaxis[ed]-yaxis[st]
        st += 1
        ed -= 1
    return res

grid = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
print(BestMeetPoint(grid))
```
