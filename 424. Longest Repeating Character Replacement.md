# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

**Note:**
Both the string's length and *k* will not exceed 104.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```



## Solution

子序列的问题，不难。试了半天更新结果的代码放哪儿。

注意格式是：

```python
while:
 	ed ++ 
 	...
 	while count > threshold:
 		...
 	if count <= threshold:
 	maxres = ...
```





## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        length = len(s)
        table = [0 for _ in range(26)]
        res = 0
        count = 0
        cursum = 0
        st = 0
        ed = 0
        while ed < length:
            # while ed<length and count <= k:
            idx = ord(s[ed])-ord('A')
            table[idx] += 1
            cursum += 1
            count = cursum-max(table)
            res = max(res,ed-st)
            ed += 1
            # print(s[st:ed])
                
            while st < ed and count > k:
                idx = ord(s[st])-ord('A')
                table[idx] -= 1
                cursum -= 1
                # if idx!=table.index(max(table)):
                #     count -= 1
                count = cursum-max(table)
                st += 1
            
            if count <= k:
                res = max(res,ed-st)
            
        return res
```
